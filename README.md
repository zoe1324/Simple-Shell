# Simple-Shell

The goal of this project was to develop a simple OS shell in C for a Unix-type system. There were several stages involved, slowly implementing more functionality with each part.

Stage 1 - Prompting the user, reading and parsing input, exiting the shell and initialising the working directory
Stage 2 - Using the fork(), wait() and exec() functions to to execute external commands
Stage 3 - Setting current directory to Home, getting and setting the path
Stage 4 - Changing directories and managing different numbers of parameters
Stage 5 - Adding to, invoking and printing commands from history
Stage 6 - Persistent history of commands made functional by saving to and loading from a file

I was mainly responsible for helping implement Stage 3, as well as debugging and helping with issues throughout.
